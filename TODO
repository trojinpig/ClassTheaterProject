Here is a list of tasks this program must perform:
• When the program begins, it should ask the user to enter the seat prices for each row.
The prices can be stored in a separate array. (Alternatively, the prices may be read
from a file.)
• Once the prices are entered, the program should display a seating chart similar to
the one shown above. The user may enter the row and seat numbers for tickets being
sold. Every time a ticket or group of tickets is purchased, the program should display
the total ticket prices and update the seating chart.
• The program should keep a total of all ticket sales. The user should be given an
option of viewing this amount.
• The program should also give the user an option to see a list of how many seats
have been sold, how many seats are available in each row, and how many seats are
available in the entire auditorium.
Input Validation: When tickets are being sold, do not accept row or seat numbers that
do not exist. When someone requests a particular seat, the program should make sure
that seat is available before it is sold.
